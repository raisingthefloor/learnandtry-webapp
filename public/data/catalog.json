The options are Auto Scanning which automatically moves to the next item after a set amount of time. If the user uses this setting with one switch then you must assign the select item action to the switch. Manual Scanning that requires at least two switches, with one switch being assigned to move to the next item action and the other assigned to the select item action. Lastly single switch step scanning that requires one switch, with the move to the next item action assigned to the switch. If no action is taken within the set amount of time, the current item is automatically selected.",
